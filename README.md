bar.js
======

overview
--------
`bar.js` was created because I couldn't find any js graphing library simple
enough for my needs. I simply wanted to create a bar chart with simple data and
text only lables. Everything out there was either very old or amazingly complex.

`bar.js` is also my *first* attempt at a raphael.js plugin, so please use with
__extreme care__.

requirements
------------
`bar.js` requires:
* jQuery
* raphael.js
